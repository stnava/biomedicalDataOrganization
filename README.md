# biomedicalDataOrganization
Describe ideas regarding data organization for medical imaging and related data.

the `src` directory contains a compilable document describing the study.

the `data` directory contains example dicom data.

the `demographics` directory contains an example csv that would be paired with NRG format imaging data.

NOTE:  the csv does not match the example data in the `data` directory; the latter is just for illustration.
